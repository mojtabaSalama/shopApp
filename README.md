## Overview

`shopApp` is a cross-platform mobile and web application built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). The app provides a seamless shopping experience, including user authentication, product listings, shopping cart, and order management.

## Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability. The main layers include:

- **Presentation Layer**: Manages UI components and user interactions.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Handles the application's business rules and state management.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data retrieval, storage, and networking.

### Layers

1. **Presentation Layer**:

   - Contains Flutter widgets responsible for rendering the UI.
   - Uses `Provider` for state management to keep the UI reactive.

2. **Business Logic Layer**:

   - Contains business logic components, such as view models or controllers.
   - Implements state management using `Provider` .

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Manages data sources, including remote APIs and local databases.
   - Uses "https://your-market.up.railway.app" as a backend link to abstract data fetching and storage logic.

## Components

### User Interface

The UI is built using Flutter's widget system. Key UI components include:

- **Signin Page**: Handles customer authentication.
- **Signup Page**: Handles customer registration.
- **Product List Page**: Displays a list of products.
- **Shopping Cart Page**: Manages the customer's shopping cart.
- **Orders Page**: Displays past orders.
- **Order Detail Page**: Shows detailed information about an order.

### State Management

State management is implemented using `Provider` to ensure the UI reacts to changes in the application state. Key state management components include:

- **CustomerProvider**: Manages Customer authentication state and data.
- **ProductProvider**: Manages the state of product data.
- **CartProvider**: Manages the state of the shopping cart.
- **OrderProvider**: Manages the state of the orders made by customers.

### Networking

Networking is handled using the `http` package. API services are abstracted into service classes that handle requests and responses.

- **CustomerAPI**: Manages customer-related API calls.
- **ProductAPI**: Manages product-related API calls.
- **OrderAPI**: Manages order-related API calls.
- **CartAPI**: Manages cart-related API calls.

### Data Persistence

Local data persistence is handled using the `shared_preferences` package for simple key-value storage.

## Data Flow

Data flow within the application follows a unidirectional pattern:

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the UI.
2. **UI Updates State**: The UI triggers state changes through providers.
3. **State Management**: Providers update the application state.
4. **Data Layer Interaction**: Providers interact with services and repositories to fetch or store data.
5. **UI Reacts to State Changes**: The UI listens to state changes and updates accordingly.

## Third-Party Libraries

The project utilizes several third-party libraries, including:

- `provider`: For state management.
- `http`: For networking.
- `shared_preferences`: For local data persistence.

## Deployment

`shopApp` supports deployment on multiple platforms:

- **Android**: Build and deploy using Android Studio or the `flutter build apk` command.
- **iOS**: Build and deploy using Xcode or the `flutter build ios` command.
- **Web**: Build using the `flutter build web` command and deploy to a web server.
- **Desktop**: Build using the `flutter build [linux|macos|windows]` command.
